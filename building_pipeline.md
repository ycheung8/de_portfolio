# Building a Machine Learning Pipeline

## Introduction

-	A machine learning pipeline orchestrates the flow of data into, and output from a machine learning model(s). 
-	Each component of a pipeline is called a step. 
-	Weâ€™ll focus on two types of methods: transform() and fit().

You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Stand-alone Projects

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

Fastest way to do a row count (through command line)
(1) Install GNUWIN, into a drive other than the C drive. 
   (for example, I installed onto the G drive)

(2) PATH=G:\ycheung\GnuWin32\bin;%PATH%

(3) Navigate to the directory location of the csv file

(4) gzip -f -9 Cohort_Waterfall_Aimovig_Migraine_Jan052022.csv
   (9 is the highest compression, 6 is the default, this replaces csv with csv.gz)

(5) count rows in original csv file using CMD
    find /v /c "" Cohort_Waterfall_Aimovig_Migraine_Jan052022_error.csv.csv
