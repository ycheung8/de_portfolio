Tips for:

(A) Compressing Large Files (such as csv)
    (1) Install GNUWIN, into a drive other than the C drive. 
        (for example, I installed onto the G drive)

    (2) Add environment variable. 
        PATH=G:\ycheung\GnuWin32\bin;%PATH%

    (3) Navigate to the directory location of the csv file

    (4) gzip -f -9 Cohort_File1.csv
       (9 is the highest compression, 6 is the default, this replaces csv with csv.gz)



(B) Counting rows in original csv file using CMD (command prompt)
    find /v /c "" row_count_test_file1.csv
